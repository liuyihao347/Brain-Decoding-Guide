## Introduction

Brief definition of Brain Decoding: 
Brain decoding (also referred to as neural decoding) is a computational and neuroscientific technique that extracts meaningful, interpretable information about an individual’s subjective mental states, perceptual experiences, cognitive processes, or behavioral intentions directly from recorded brain activity (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG, or invasive neural recordings). It relies on machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling, and neuroscientific insights to map patterns of neural activity to specific mental content—moving beyond simply detecting brain activation to decoding the representational information encoded in neural signals, with applications in neuroscience research, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and clinical neuroscience.
